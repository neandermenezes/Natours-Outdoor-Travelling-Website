# Natours-Outdoor-Travelling-Website
A beautiful website built with react and sass, from Jonas Schmedtmann advanced css &amp; sass course

# Goals
Developed during Jonas Schmedtmann Advanced CSS/SASS course in order to aid my Front-end studies at Trybe.

Learned basic SASS along good practices such as breaking each style into files (abstracts, base, components, layout, pages, etc)

https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/

This application was built with React, although it doesn't make any sense since there are no reausability, i was at the time in the beggining of Trybe's Front-end module and figured i wouldn't lose anything by using React on this application.

## How to run it
```bash
Clone the repository
- npm install
- npm start
```
