# Natours-Outdoor-Travelling-Website
A beautiful website built with react and sass, from Jonas Schmedtmann advanced css &amp; sass course

# Goals
Developed during Jonas Schmedtmann Advanced CSS/SASS course in order to aid my Front-end studies at Trybe.

Learned basic SASS along good practices such as breaking each style into files (abstracts, base, components, layout, pages, etc)

This application was built with React, although it doesn't make any sense since there are no reausability, i was at the time in the beggining of Trybe's Front-end module and figured i wouldn't lose anything by using React on this application.

## How to run it
```bash
Clone the repository
- npm install
- npm start
```
